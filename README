linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.?
======================

Linux DVB API test/demo applications and utilities.

You will find a README in each subdirectory explaining what the code there does.
For beginners utils/gnutv/ and utils/scan/ are probably most useful.

szap/czap/tzap/azap are now deprecated in favour of the new unified
application 'gnutv'. This new program can do everything the original 
applications did. However, it adds significant new functionality, 
such as controlling CAMs, and streaming tv in a variety of ways.

For convenience, dvb-apps contains a copy of the DVB API include
files as they are contained in the linuxtv-dvb-1.? release
and the 2.6.x Linux kernel. However, since the DVB API hasn't changed,
the apps will still work with the old "DVB" drivers, should you decide not
to use linuxtv-dvb-1.? (or the dvb-kernel HG).
