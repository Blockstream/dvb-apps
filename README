This tree contains Linux DVB API test/demo applications and utilities.

These have been copied from the "DVB" CVS tree, which means that
the stuff in "DVB" is now unmaintained and out of date.

For convenience, dvb-apps contains a copy of the DVB API include
files as they are contained in dvb-kernel and the 2.6.x Linux
kernel. However, since the DVB API hasn't changed, the apps
will still work with the old "DVB" drivers, should you decide not
to use dvb-kernel.

You find a README in each subdirectory explaining what the code there does.
For beginners the utils/szap and utils/scan directory are probably most useful.
