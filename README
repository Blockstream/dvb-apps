linuxtv-dvb-apps-1.1.0
======================

Linux DVB API test/demo applications and utilities.

You find a README in each subdirectory explaining what the code there does.
For beginners utils/szap/ and utils/scan/ are probably most useful.

For convenience, dvb-apps contains a copy of the DVB API include
files as they are contained in the linuxtv-dvb-1.1.0 realease
and the 2.6.x Linux kernel. However, since the DVB API hasn't changed,
the apps will still work with the old "DVB" drivers, should you decide not
to use linuxtv-dvb-1.1.0 (or the dvb-kernel CVS).


Historical note:
The apps have been copied from the "DVB" CVS tree, which means that
the stuff in "DVB" is now unmaintained and out of date.
