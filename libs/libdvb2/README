 This library was initially intended as helper library for the
 DVBv3 API, but it quickly became apparent that that would not
 suffice. As hardware change, so does it's features.

 Primary goals:

  - C implementation of the common interface stack,
    that abstracts all layers and can interface equally
    with a link layer as an application layer interface.

  - Linking the internal conditional access layer to
    the demuxer, so that decryption can be controlled
    internally to the extent possible.

  - Automatic parsing of PAT and PMT, so application
    always knows where it is and what it's able to get.

  - Easy interface to parse any tables, wether understood
    by the library or not.

 Secondary goals:

  - Finish this README ;)
