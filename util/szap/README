Hi,

this are some trivial zapping applications explaining how to use the frontend
and demux API. They are also pretty useful to test your hardware.

For DVB-S, Astra Channel config file:

$ ./szap -c channels.conf-dvbs-astra n24

will tune to N24. For DVB-C, Berlin Cable channel config:

$ ./czap -c channels.conf-dvbc-berlin Arte

For DVB-T, Berlin Config:

$ ./czap -c channels.conf-dvbt-berlin phoenix

By default the MPEG stream is routed to a hardware decoder. If you want to 
record the stream to disk you will route it to the DVR device by using the 
'-r' option:

$ ./czap -c channels.conf-dvbt-berlin phoenix -r
[keep it running in one console]
$ cat /dev/dvr/adapter0/dvr0 > /tmp/recording.ts
[in a second console, will dump the MPEG transport stream to /tmp/recording.ts]

The status messages have the following meaning:

status 0x1f              --- The demodulator status bits.
			      0x1f means all bits set, everything ok.

signal [0x0000...0xffff] --- Signal Strength. Values above 0x8000 should be ok.

snr [0x0000...0xffff]    --- Signal/Noise Ratio. Values above 0x8000 are ok.

ber [0...0xffffffff]     --- Bit Error Rate. The less the better.

unc [0...0xffffffff]     --- Number of Uncorrectable Blocks.
			     Small numbers are Preferable.

If everything is alright and all frontend circuits are working stable 
(are locked) you should see a FE_HAS_LOCK in the rightmost line.

Good luck,

Holger
