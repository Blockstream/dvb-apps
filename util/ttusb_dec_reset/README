Hello,

This is a small utility for resetting a ttusb-dec device after use.  It
requires libusb, which can be found here:

http://libusb.sourceforge.net/

There is probably a package for it included with your linux distribution
though.

For the utility to reset a device, it must have permission to access the usb
device, and the device must not be claimed by anything else.  That means that
the ttusb-dec module must be rmmoded before using this utility.  You probably
want to have turned off any hotplug mechanisms before running the utility
or the device will likely get taken over again once it comes back up.  Or you
could just yank the usb cable out.

The utility takes no arguments, you just run it:
./ttusb_dec_reset

Cheers,
Alex
