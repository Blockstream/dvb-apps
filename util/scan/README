Hi,

this is a little channel scan utility to generate szap/tzap/czap compatible 
channel lists. Scan does not do a frequency scan, however, so you must
manually provide the data for tuning to one or more start transponders.
A number of initial-tuning-data files are provided for various dvb-c, dvb-s
and dvb-t networks around the world. If you make a new one feel free to
submit it to the linux-dvb mailing list http://linuxtv.org/mailinglists.xml.

Basic usage: ./scan dvb-s/Astra-19.2E | tee mychannels.conf

If you want it to check a specific frequency, tune to that frequency 
(e.g. using szap/tzap/czap) and then use './scan -c'.

For more scan options see ./scan -h.

Good luck,
Holger + Johannes
