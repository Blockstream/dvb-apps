/**
 * The file backend consists of multiple lines as follows:
 *
 * <adapter_id> <source_id> ...
 *
 * <adapter_id> identifies a DVB adapter in the system. The following adapter_ids are supported:
 *
 *   DVB<dvb_type><adapter_number>.<frontend_number>
 *   ATSC<adapter_number>.<frontend_number>
 *
 *   <dvb_type> is one of 'S', 'T', or 'C'(DVBS, DVBT, and DVBC respectively)
 *   <adapter_number> is the number allocated to the DVB device by the OS (i.e. /dev/dvb/adapterX)
 *   <frontend_number> is the frontend ID on a particular DVB device (i.e. /dev/dvb/adapterX/frontendY)
 *
 * <source_id> corresponds to an entry in the dvbcfg_sources file. Multiple
 * source_ids can be specified for an adapter, indicating it can be automatically
 * switched between them in some manner (e.g. by using DISEQC for DVBS adapters).
 *
 * Comments begin with '#' - any characters after this will be ignored
 * to the end of the line.
 *
 * Examples:
 * DVBS0.0 S5E S7E
 * DVBC1.0
 * DVBT2.0 Tuk-BlackHill
