Late in 2003 the idea to create a simple DVB library from the code snippets
in the test/utility programs was discussed on the linux-dvb mailing list.
Hopefully someone will invest some time in this project to turn the idea into
reality...

Here is an outline of what libdvb2 should be, according to my recollection:
(For first hand information search the linux-dvb list archives for "libdvb2".)

- C
- small: The goal is to make the library usable in *any* DVB project, which
  is easier if the library sticks to the basics. Advanced stuff can be
  done in a second library. What exacty "basic" and "advanced" means
  is subject of discussion, but I want avoid to impose a certain programming
  model (e.g. multi-threaded vw. event-loop) on users of the library.
- a prime target is to establish a standard DVB config and service list
  format, to make this sharable between different applications
- LGPL

About the name: There already is a libdvb written by the Metzler Bros.,
but the main drawback is that it is written in C++ and thus rejected
by many projects.
